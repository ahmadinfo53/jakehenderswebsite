            <h3>About</h3>
            <p>I’ve been writing for as long as I can remember, but it wasn’t until 2019 that I turned my passion into a
                career. Over
                the years, I’ve worked in a variety of genres, from fiction and non-fiction to content creation for
                businesses. My
                writing journey began with a fascination for storytelling, a love for language, and a desire to make
                people feel, think,
                and connect through words.
                <br><br>

                I grew up surrounded by books, and I started writing my first short story when I was 19. What began as a
                hobby
                eventually blossomed into a professional pursuit. Along the way, I’ve published stories in various
                literary magazines,
                written blog posts for businesses, and helped brands find their unique voice through compelling copy.
